    title: 'Category Theory for Collective Intelligence',
    shortDescription: 'Exploring how category theory can illuminate deep structural patterns in collective intelligence systems, focusing on information flows and emergent behaviors.',
    fullDescription: `This project explores how category theory can illuminate the deep structural patterns in collective intelligence systems, particularly focusing on how different components interact and combine to create emergent behaviors. The research aims to develop formal mathematical frameworks that capture how information flows and transforms across different scales of collective systems, from scientific communities to markets.

The insights could help design systems that naturally preserve beneficial properties as they scale and evolve.`,
    workingStyle: 'The team embodies a Platonic approach to mathematics, seeking to uncover fundamental structures that exist across different manifestations of collective intelligence. Their methodology draws from the tradition of pure mathematics - starting with abstract patterns and gradually connecting them to concrete implementations.',

The project examines how principles from biological collective intelligence - from embryonic development to ant colonies - could inform the design of more robust artificial systems.

The goal is to understand and replicate nature's solutions to key AI safety challenges like maintaining goal-directedness without rigid hierarchies.`,

The research combines insights from biological immune systems, network science, and information theory to develop robust defensive mechanisms that emerge from local interactions rather than central control.

The work aims to create networks that naturally strengthen through challenge while preserving essential functions.`,
